Clustering is one of the most applied unsuper-vised machine learning tasks. Although there exist several clustering algorithms for numeric data, more sophisticated clustering algorithms to address mixed data (numeric and cat-egorical data) more efficiently are still required. Other impor-tant issues to be considered in clustering are incremental learning and generating a sufficient number of clusters with-out specifying the number of clusters a priori. In this paper, we introduce a mixed data clustering method which is incre-mental and generates a sufficient number of clusters automat-ically. The proposed method is based on the Adjusted Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network (ASOINN) algo-rithm exploiting a new distance measure and new update rules for handling mixed data. The proposed clustering method is compared with the ASOINN and three other clustering algo-rithms comprehensively. The results of comparative experi-ments on various data sets using several clustering evaluation measures show the effectiveness of the proposed mixed data clustering method.
